Before your Beamtime
====================

This page is a check list of things each user must do before beamtime
at BMM.  Several tasks on this page are called out in caution boxes
that look like this:

.. caution::

   This is a caution box.

Failure to do the tasks on this page will result in delay or
cancellation of your experiment.

:TL;DR: *pay attention to the caution boxes.*

Register for BNL Site Access
----------------------------

Upon receipt of notification of your beamtime, verify that all
the team members attending your experiment have a valid BNL Guest
registration. 

An experimenter who is not listed on the original proposal (for
example, a student who recently joined the research group), will not
receive reminder emails about the need for a BNL appointment.  So, be
sure **everyone** coming to the beamline has a valid appointment.

.. note::

   + New registration requests as well as extension requests for
     expired registrations should be submitted as soon as possible.
   + Time required for approval of a guest registrations:

     + **US citizens**: 7 days
     + **Citizens of non-sensitive countries**: 14 days
     + **Citizens of sensitive countries**: 45 days

   + `Definition of sensitive country <https://www.state.gov/countries-of-particular-concern-special-watch-list-countries-entities-of-particular-concern/>`__

Apply for a BNL Guest appointment: https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/beforearrival.php 

.. caution::  Without an active appointment, you will not be allowed
	      on site and will be turned away at the main gate. 

.. note:: When you arrive at BNL, you must have proper identification.
	  Here is guidance on the identification requirements:
	  https://www.bnl.gov/guv/id.php


BNL Domain Account
------------------

When your BNL Guest registration becomes active, you should receive an
email with instructions for enabling your BNL domain account. You must
do this, including setting your password and signing up for DUO
Federal two-factor authentication.  

If you need to request an account, go to https://www.bnl.gov/accounts/
and click the button that says "Submit account registration form".

Enabling your BNL account is non-optional. You must have an active
account in order to unlock the computers at the beamline or to access
your data.

.. caution:: Without an active account, a known password, and DUO
	     Federal two-factor authentication, you will be unable to
	     perform your experiment and unable to access the data
	     from the experiment.

Safety Approval Form
--------------------

Submit your Safety Approval Form (SAF) **at least** two weeks before
the start date for your experiment.  Your SAF should provide a
complete and accurate description of the experiment, including all
samples, chemicals, solvents, reference materials, and equipment that
will be used during the experiment and for sample preparation.  In
addition, any additional equipment not provided by the beamline has to
be identified and described in the SAF.  Provide detailed information
on sample processing and any safety measures necessary.

.. caution:: An approved SAF is required on the first day of beamtime.
	     An experiment cannot begin without an approved SAF.  If
	     you do not allow adequate time for approval, you may lose
	     your beamtime.

To submit a SAF: https://pass.bnl.gov

If your experiment requires **chemicals, compressed gases, lab access,
or other equipment**, please contact Bruce Ravel (bravel@bnl.gov) well
ahead of your expriment.  Transportation of hazardous materials
related to your experiment to the BNL site and back to the home
institution is your responsibility.

If your experiment involves **radiological materials** (including
depleted uranium), it is essential that you submit your SAF as early
as possible to allow plenty of time for safety review. The SAF should
include an attachment that clearly itemizes isotopes present including
masses and activities for each isotope.


Support Laboratories
--------------------

Currently, four labs support user activities at BMM.  They are:

+ Lab 3L-L06: XAS Sample Prep Lab
+ Lab 3L-L07: Environmental Science Wet Lab
+ Lab 3L-L09: XAS Chemistry Lab
+ Lab 4L-L09: Electrochemistry Lab

See https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/labs/ for details of what equipment is
available in each lab.

If you prepare or treat samples on-site, you **must** request use of
the appropriate NSLS-II User Laboratory when you submit your Safety
Approval Form.

You cannot request a laboratory after an SAF has been approved.  

Here is some advice on selecting the correct lab:

Unbound nanoparticles
  Please note that supported nanoparticles or nanoparticles in
  solution are not considered “unbound”.  If your samples are indeed
  unbound, please contact BMM beamline scientist Bruce Ravel
  (bravel@bnl.gov) as soon as possible.  

Solid sample preparation (pellet pressing, spreading on tape, etc)
  Request Lab 3L-L06.

Liquid samples (organic solvents, acids, bases) and simple chemistry
  Request Lab 3L-L09.
  
Hydrofluoric acid treatment
  Request Lab 3L-L09 and notify the Cognizant Space Manager, Syed Khalid
  (khalid@bnl.gov), as soon as possible. 

Environmental and earth science sample preparation and treatment
  Request Lab 3L-L07.
  
Electrochemistry and battery science
  Request Lab 4L-L09.

.. admonition:: Radiological samples
   :class: important

   Radionuclide samples must be prepared and properly contained at the
   home institution.  NSLS-II has no lab available for work on
   radiological materials.  Samples with depleted uranium, uranium at
   low or environmentally relevant concentrations, or naturally
   occurring uranium or thorium **are** considered to be radiological
   samples at NSLS-II and must be treated as such.

Requests for using gloveboxes should be discussed prior to submitting
the SAF, contact Bruce Ravel (bravel@bnl.gov) and/or Syed Khalid
(khalid@bnl.gov)

.. important:: Each lab you select on your safety approval form makes work
	       for the lab stewards.  Only request the lab(s) that you
	       actually intend to use.

Training
--------

Please complete all required online user training at least one week
before the starting date.  

To complete your training, follow the training instructions at:
https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/userguide/before-arrival.php#step2

Links to specific courses:

+ `Cyber Security Training (GE-CYBERSEC) <https://training.bnl.gov/portal/GE-CYBERSEC>`__
+ `Computer Use Agreement (GE-COMPUSE-AGREE) <https://training.bnl.gov/portal/GE-COMPUSE-AGREE>`__
+ `General Employee Radiation Training (TQ-GERT) <https://training.bnl.gov/portal/TQ-GERT>`__
+ `NSLS-II Safety Module (PS-NSLS-II-USER-MOD) <https://training.bnl.gov/portal/PS-NSLS-II-USER-MOD>`__
+ `Guest Site Orientation (TQ-GSO) <https://training.bnl.gov/portal/TQ-GSO>`__

Returning users can `check training status online <https://www.bnl.gov/training/>`__.


.. caution::

   Failure to complete training will result in a delay starting your
   experiment.


Electrical Equipment
--------------------

Any equipment with an electrical cable including low-voltage
instruments and sample holderss are considered electrical equipment
(laptop computers are excluded) and are subject to an electrical
equipment inspection (EEI).

If you plan to bring electrical equipment for your experiment, go to
http://bit.ly/m/eei to fill out the EEI request form.

The EEI request form includes questions describing the user supplied
equipment, thus is a chore better suited for the user who has
knowledge of the equipment coming to the beamline.

.. caution:: Failure to schedule an EEI will result in a delay to your
	     experiment.  Equipment that cannot pass EEI may not be used
	     at NSLS-II.

Note that some already-approved electrical equipment (e.g.,
potentiostat, heaters, cryostats, temperature controllers, sample
spinners, and more) is available at the beamline.


Research Equipment Pool
-----------------------

Some experimental tools are available from `the NSLS-II Research
Equipment Pool
<https://public.bnl.gov/sites/rep/SitePages/Home.aspx>`__.  If you
wish to use any items from the equipment pool, contact Bruce Ravel
(bravel@bnl.gov) well ahead of your experiment.

If you wish to use a potentiostat in lab 4L-L09 to pre-condition
battery or other electrochemical samples, contact Bruce
(bravel@bnl.gov) to have a potentiostat from the equipment
pool reserved for you.


Shipping things to the beamline
-------------------------------

Packages should be shipped to

.. code-block:: none

   Bruce Ravel / Beamline 6BM
   Building 740
   Brookhaven National Laboratory
   Upton NY 11973

If shipping radiological materials, **do not ship samples directly to
the beamline**.  Follow the `instructions for radiological materials
transport
<https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/userguide/shipping.php#tabs-2>`__.

Allow sufficient time for your samples to arrive before your
experiment begins.  Plan for shipping delays.  Be aware that the
transport company will report a package as "delivered" when it arrives
at BNL shipping and receiving.  It takes additional time for a package
to arrive at the beamline.

While samples cannot be stored after your experiment, it is OK for
samples to arrive a few days prior to your experiment.  The same is
true for radiological samples.  The radiological control technicians
can hold onto samples for a few days before delivery to the beamline.

You will not compensated for beamtime lost to delays in sample delivery.


The Day of your Experiment
--------------------------

.. note:: Unless told otherwise, your experiment starts at 8 am.  

You should consider having all team members arrive the afternoon prior
to the first day of the beamtime to check in at `the GUV Center
<https://www.bnl.gov/guv/>`__ and to complete beamline specific
training.

The GUV Center opens at `7 a.m. on weekdays
<https://www.bnl.gov/guv/check-in.php>`__, so it is possible to obtain
badges and access cards prior to the 8 a.m. start time of your
experiment.

Please consult `NSLS-II user guide <https://www.bnl.gov/ps/userguide/>`__
or contact BMM beamline staff for more information.

.. ADMONITION:: **NSLS-II Attire** 
   :class: caution

   At a minimum, all users are required to wear long pants or
   skirt/dress that extends to the ankle, short-sleeve or long sleeve
   shirts, and shoes that enclose the entire foot for entry to NSLS-II
   non-office areas, which includes the experimental floor and sample
   preparation laboratories.

   Pants with extensive ripping do not meet this PPE requirement.
