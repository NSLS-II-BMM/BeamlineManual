Beamline instrumentation
========================

This section provides a brief overview of the instrumentation
available for various kinds of routine and *in situ* experiments.

If you have questions about any of these tools or wish to pursue other
experimental options, contact the beamline staff.

Fluorescence detectors
----------------------

The standard fluorescence detector at BMM is a `seven element silicon
drift detector
<https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/us/en/products/analytical-systems/sdd/vortex-me7.html>`__
with an `Xspress3 <https://quantumdetectors.com/products/xspress3/>`_
readout.  This normally sits on a linear stage so that distance to the
sample can be user-controlled and incorporated into :numref:`beamline
automation (Section %s) <automation>`.

We also have a `single element silicon drift detector
<https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/us/en/products/analytical-systems/sdd/vortex-90ex.html>`__
which is useful in certain situations.  If your experimental setup
requires placing the detector in an unusual orientation, the single
element detector can be used.  Unlike the 7-element detector, the
single element is not required to remain in an upright orientation
during operation.  While the single element detector sees fewer
photons, this versatility of setup is occasionally very helpful.

   silicon drift detector.


BMM has an elderly 4-element SDD as a back-up detector.

The 7-element detector sits on an XYZ stage for alignment with the beam.

==============  ===============================
 axis            purpose
==============  ===============================
``xafs_detx``    proximity to sample
``xafs_dety``    vertical position
``xafs_detz``    uypstream/downstream position
==============  ===============================

The ``xafs_detx`` stage is fully retracted at a position of 205.  The
closest position is often something close to 0, but that depends on
the details of the sample stage and will be set as a soft limit at the
beginning of an experiment. To
fully retract the stage, do

.. code:: python

   RE(mv(xafs_detx, 205))

The ``xafs_dety`` stage is normally at position 0.  Position 0 is
chosen to have the beam at the height of the center element of the
detector.  When using the :numref:`glancing angle stage (Section %s)
<glancing-angle-stage>` in the parallel orientation, move ``xafs_dety``
to position 20.

.. code:: python

   RE(mv(xafs_dety, 20))

The ``xafs_detz`` stage moves the detector upstream or downstream
according to the details of the sample mount.  It is usually good
enough to align this by eye.  A more careful alignment can be made
with a :numref:`linescan (Section %s) <linescan>`:

.. code:: python

   RE(linescan(xafs_detz, 'if', -10, 10, 51))

Note that this scan will optimize the signal in the ROI, but may not
serve to minimize elastic scattering or to balance signal between the
sides of the detector.



Electron yield detector

   in use and that its signal should be plotted in real time.


Area detector
-------------

An older model of the `Pilatus 100K
<https://www.dectris.com/detectors/x-ray-detectors/pilatus3/pilatus3-for-synchrotrons/pilatus3-x/>`_
is available.

   Dectris Pilatus 100K


Please note:

+ BMM offers only limited integration of data output into the XAS end
  station workflow.
+ BMM has limited options for mounting and integrating the Pilatus
  into your experiments.
+ This Pilatus has a rather small detection area and a rather large
  pixel size (about 170 microns).

BMM does not currently have access to a larger/better/faster detector.

Using CHIPS Act funding, we are in the process of procuring a new
large area detector for use with the XRD end station.  This detector
will eventually become available for experiments at the XAS end
station, perhaps by 2026.


.. _sample-wheel:

Sample wheel
------------

At BMM, the standard *ex situ* sample stage is a laser-cut plastic
disk. The disk has 24 or 48 slots cut from the disk.  These are the
sample positions. 

This disk is mounted on a rotation stage.  The slots are 15 degrees
apart, so moving from sample to sample only involves moving through a
known rotation angle.  

The rotation stage is mounted on the XY stage, allowing alignment of
the sample holder to the incident beam.


.. _fig-wheel_stageINST:
.. figure:: _images/stages/wheel_stage.jpg
   :target: _images/wheel_stage.jpg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   The standard *ex situ* sample holder is a plastic disk with slots
   for the sample positions.


Here are photos of some of the sample holder options.  There are
designs which use slots or circles for the sample position.  The
circular holes are 13 mm, which is a common size for a pellet press.
13 mm pellets can usually slip snugly into those holes.

Samples can be packed into the slots or holes.  More commonly, samples
are prepared in some manner and affixed to the front of the sample
holder with tape.

There is also a design which is, essentially, a normal disk cut in
half.  That one holds fewer samples, but is easier to load and unload
from a glove box during sample preparation.

   both styles, there are options with 13mm x 3 mm slots or 13mm
   diameter holes. (Right) A half wheel suitable for loading in a
   glove box.



We consider these *ex situ* holders to be consumable items.  We will
happily mail several of them to you prior to your experiment so that
you can arrive with samples pre-mounted and ready to be measured.  You
may keep the sample holders to use again the next time you visit BMM.



Electrochemistry
----------------

At BMM, we have a `BioLogic VSP-300 Potentiostat
<https://www.biologic.net/products/vsp-300/>`_ which is available for
all manner of electrochemistry experimentation. This is a 6 channel
model, allowing you to prep samples during measurements or to run
multiple electrochemistry experiments in parallel, moving those cells
into and out of the beam.

   The BioLogic VSP-300 Potentiostat

We run the vendor-supplied control software on a Windows 10 instance
running in a virtual container.  Your electrochemical data will be
saved to the ``assets/vsp300-1/`` folder in your :numref:`proposal
folder (Section %s) <data>`.

.. note::

   We do not, at this time, have EPICS-level control of the
   potentiostat.  This limits the level of automation and integration
   with the rest of the beamline.

   DSSI has implemented external triggering and collection of current
   and voltage using the `Quantum Detectors PandABox
   <https://quantumdetectors.com/products/pandabox/>`__.  This may
   become available to BMM users sometime in 2025.

BMM does not provide electrochemical cells.  The user is expected to
bring their own cells.  Ideally, the electrochemistry has been tested
in the cells intended for use at the beamline and are known to produce
reliable electrochemical results.


Temperature control
-------------------

BMM has two options for experiments at elevated or reduced temperature.


Linkam stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Linkam stage <https://www.linkam.co.uk/thms600>`_ has LN2 flow
for cooling a sample down to 77K and a resistive heater to go up to
600C. The volume inside can be pumped or exposed to flowing gas.  The
sample stage at the center is modified to have a 3mm diameter hole for
transmission XAFS.

   (Left) The Linkham stage mounted for transmission on the sample
   stage.  (Right) The 25 L dewar used for cooling the Linkam stage.

BMM has two dewars for use with the Linkam.  The 2 L dewar has enough
capacity for about 2 hours of measurement.  The 25 L dewar runs for
about 14 hours and is the standard choice.  The advantage of the
smaller dewar is that it is smaller and might be needed for
complicated setups were space is at a premium.

Extensive :numref:`automation (Section %s) <auto_linkam>` is available
for the Linkam stage.

Displex Cryostat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BMM also has a helium compression cryostat capable of reducing
temperature at the sample to around 10K and with a resistive heater
allowing a sample temperature range of 10K to about 400K.

This Displex model is designed for low-vibration applications.  as a
result, it is a bit slow to cool down, requiring about 2 hours to get
to 10K from room temperature. Sample changes are a bit laborious
due to the construction of the vacuum shroud.

Extensive :numref:`automation (Section %s) <auto_lakeshore>` is available
for the Displex using the LakeShore 331 temperature controller..

.. _glancing-angle-stage:

Glancing angle and thin film stage
----------------------------------

We use this glancing angle stage for high-throughput studies of thin
film and other flat samples.  The apparatus shown below rests on a
rotation stage for moving up to 8 samples into and out of the beam.
The rotation stage sits on a tilt stage, allowing fine control of the
incident angle.  Each sample position is a spinner, which is used to
suppress diffraction from the substrate.

In most cases, sample translation and sample alignment is
:numref:`fully automated (Section %s) <auto_ga>`

.. _fig-glancinganglestageINST:

   The glancing angle stage with 8 sample positions.


While a standing wave experiment might be feasible at BMM, the much
more typical application is a simple glancing angle measurement in
which the point of the shallow angle is to spread the beam out over
the full length of the sample.  This significantly increases the
number of atoms involved in the measurement.


.. _tilt-stage:

Tilt and rotation stages
------------------------

Also available are a `Huber pitch and roll stage
<https://www.xhuber.com/en/products/1-components/12-rotation/2-circle-segments/520310/>`__
in the form of an Eulerian cradle and a `compact rotary stage
