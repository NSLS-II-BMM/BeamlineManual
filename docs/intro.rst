Introduction to BMM
===================

BMM is NIST's :red:`B`\ eamline for :red:`M`\ aterials :red:`M`\ easurement.

At the unix command line, type ``bsui`` to start the BlueSky user
interface.  |bsui| is simply an `Ipython shell <https://ipython.org/>`_
with some customizations specific to BlueSky.  On top of that, there
are a number of customizations specific to BMM.


In this user manual, there are chapters covering most of the chores
one will need to do at the beamline, including:

#. moving motors
#. changing the state of the photon delivery system
#. making motor scans
#. making energy scans
#. interacting with the beamline's electronic log book
#. troubleshooting common problems

TL;DR

**Open/close the shutter**
   ``shb.open()`` and ``shb.close()``, see :numref:`{name}, Section {number} <shutters>`

The user experience
-------------------

The Ipython/|bsui| prompt at BMM is modified to provide at-a-glance
information about the state of the beamline.

.. _fig-prompt:
.. figure:: _images/software/prompt.png
   :target: _images/software/prompt.png
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   The BlueSky user prompt at BMM

* The green ``BMM`` indicates that the beamline is :numref:`set up and
  ready for the user (see Section %s) <start_end>`.  When the beamline
  is not ready for users, the ``BMM`` string is red.

* The string ``D.111`` indicates that the photon delivery system is in
  :numref:`mode D (see Table %s) <pds-modes>` and that :numref:`the
  Si(111) monochromator (Section %s) <change-crystals>` is in use.

* The green number in square brackets is an incremented count of how
  many commands have been issued since |bsui| was started.

* If the prompt starts with three red exclamation points |nd| something like 

      :red:`!!!` :green:`BMM` D.111 :green:`[1]`

  that means that some motors were not connected when Bluesky started.
  Contact beamline staff immediately!

CA Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the top of the some screens, you see a crude-but-handy beamline
monitor.  It looks something like this:

This provides a concise (but rather color-blind-unfriendly) overview of
the state of the beamline.

.. _slack:

Slack and Data Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning of your experiment, you will be invited to the BMM
Slack workspace.  There you can follow along with the progress of the
experiment in the ``#pass-123456-bmm channel``, where ``123456`` will
be the proposal number of your experiment.

There is also a channel called ``#pass-123456`` which is for use as a
discussion channel.

Throughout the course of the experiment, messages and figures will be
automatically posted to that channel.  This allows someone to keep
track of progress and to keep an eye on data quality without being
physically at the beamline.

   An example of messages and a picture of measured data posted to the
   beamline Slack channel.

.. attention::
   
   As of the 2024-1 cycle, BMM is no longer syncing data automatically
   to Google Drive.  Data are now available to users via sftp with
   proper authentication.  See :numref:`Data Access (Section %s)
   <data>`.

   As of the 2025-2 cycle, BMM is using the NSLS-II Slack channels.
   The old BMM Slack with the ``#beamtime`` channel has been retired.




..
  Electrochemistry experiments
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  .. note:: January 2022

     Electrochemistry is not yet properly supported in the experimental
     work flow.  This section is remains aspirational.

  The data acquisition system at BMM has rudimentary support for
  electrochemistry experiments using the BioLogic potentiostat.  When
  starting a new experiment, do this::

    BMMuser.begin_experiment(name='Betty Cooper', date='2019-02-29', gup=123456, saf=654321, echem=True)

  The ``echem`` argument, when set to ``True`` tells the system to look
  for data from the potentiostat in the appropriate place on the Windows
  computer running the EC-Lab software.  It will make a folder called
  ``electrochemistry`` in the data folder and make a folder on the
  Windows machine at ``C:Users\xf06nm\My Documents\EC-Lab\Data``.
  There will be a folder with the PI's name and a subfolder with the
  start date of the experiment.

  At the end of the experiment, the electrochemistry files are copied
  from the Windows machine to the data folder.  This puts all of the
  data in one place and makes sure that the electrochemistry data are
  backed up correctly.

A Bit about BMM
---------------

BMM is an XAS beamline.  As such it is on the simpler end of things at
NSLS-II.  We use an NSLS-II `three-pole wiggler (3PW)
<https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/project/source_properties.asp>`_ as our
photon source.  This provides broadband radiation throughout the hard
X-ray range, up to about 30 keV.  It is a small device |nd| only about
40 cm long and with a magnetic path length of about 12 cm |nd| which
is inserted in a short section between the two bend magnets in the
dual-bend achromat lattice at NSLS-II.  The flux is certainly not the
equal of any of the many-pole insertion devices in the straight, but
it is highly performant for many XAS experiment.

About 13 meters from the source, we have a paraboloid collimating
mirror.  This position is well within the storage ring tunnel and
about 12 meters from the entrance to the BMM first optical enclosure.
We placed a mirror at that location to capture the largest possible
swath of the divergent light coming from the 3PW source.  A paraboloid
is the correct shape for focusing light in both the horizontal and
vertical directions.  However, a paraboloid must be a fixed figure,
fixed angle device in order to optimally collimate the light.  Because
the mirror is in the front end, thus inaccessible during operations,
we found the paraboloid to be an attractive solution.  Once aligned in
the beam, it should never need adjustment.

The collimated light is delivered to a double crystal monochromator
(DCM).  The DCM has pairs of Si(111) and Si(311) crystals which are
accessed by :numref:`translating the DCM vacuum vessel laterally
(Section %s) <change-crystals>` .  A transition between the two
crystal sets takes about 2 minutes.

After the DCM, we have a toroidal focusing mirror followed by a flat
harmonic rejection mirror.  One or both of these mirrors is in the
beam depending on :numref:`the configuration of the XAS experiment
(Section %s) <change-mode>` in the end station.  Because the beam is
deflected upward after the collimating mirror, at least one of the
mirrors after the DCM must be used in order to deflect the beam
through the lengthy transport pipe and into the end station.

Because the collimating mirror is at a fixed angle, it only serves as
a harmonic rejection mirror above an energy determined by its
operating angle.  That turns out to be about 23.5 keV.  For XAS
experiments conducted above 8 keV, then, the harmonic rejection
provided by the collimating mirror is adequate.  At lower energies,
the flat harmonic rejection mirror is used to provide clean beam.

With just the harmonic rejection mirror in place, a beam of size 8 mm
by 1 mm is delivered to the end station.  For many XAS experiments,
this rather large beam is desirable.  Indeed, many of the visitors to
BMM specifically request the large beam for their experiments.  With
the focusing mirror in place, that large swath is reduced to a spot of
about 300 |mu| m by 250 |mu| m.
