Common chores
=============

In this section, a variety of procedures around the beamline are
explained in detail.


Search the Hutch
----------------

The buttons on the hutch interlock panel are labeled with black
stickers with white numbers.  Those labels correspond to the numbering
in these lists.  Note that there is no step #4 when opening the hutch
and no step #2 when closing.

To OPEN the hutch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ 6. Close the shutter
+ 5. Press the "SBE" button
+ 4. ∙∙∙
+ 3. Make sure the “Front Left Maglock” button is not green
+ 2. Press the green “Open Door” button, wait for the slow door to open
+ 1. Enter the hutch


To CLOSE the hutch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone but the person performing the search should leave the hutch.

The search is done by and only one person.  Only one person pushes all
the buttons.  The serach **is not** a team sport!

1. Complete the hutch search 

   + Wait for others to exit the hutch
   + Look in the mirror to see that no one is behind the table
   + Press search button 1
   + Visually inspect the length of the hutch, verifying that it is empty of people
   + Press search button 2
   + Exit the hutch

2. ∙∙∙
3. Push the “Front Left Maglock” button. It should be lit green
4. Push and hold the yellow “Close Door” button. Listen for the magnetic latch
5. Push the "SBE" button, wait for the loud noise to finish
6. You can now open the shutter

Hutch search sign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions are printed, laminated, mounted on a magnetic
sheet, and hung near the search station.  I would like to make these
signs in various languages.  If you would like to help by translating
this sign, download the Word document below.  Make a translation into
your language and mail the Word doc back to Bruce.  He will print and
mount the new translation!  I am most eager for Chinese, Russian, and
German translations.

Change energy and prepare for fluorescence measurements
-------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we are using Fe as the example.  That is, we assume
you are moving the beamline to the state in which it is ready to
measure at the Fe K edge.  For any other edge, simply change ``Fe`` to
the appropriate element in the following example.

When you change samples, don’t forget to put the detector in a safe
state before swapping out the sample wheel. Move the detector all the
way back – ``RE(mv(xafs_detx, 205))`` – then put the cap back on the
detector. Once you have secured the new sample wheel, remove the cap
before searching the hutch.

Once the hutch is secured and you are back at the computer:

#. Change edge with the ``RE(change_edge(‘Fe’))`` command. Wait for it
   to finish and return to the command line. (See :numref:`{name},
   Section {number} <pds>` for details.)

#. Move the detector to middle position, say, 100: ``RE(mv(xafs_detx,
   100))`` The range of positions for that motor is 205 (farthest back)
   to about 20 (very close to sample).  You can check the lower limit
   with ``xafs_detx.limits``.

#. Measure an XRF spectra: ``%xrf``. Remember that you want the OCR
   (total count rate) to be 200,000 or less on each of the seven
   channels.

#. Adjust the detector position ``RE(mv(xafs_detx, <value>))``.
   Remeasure ``%xrf``.  Iterate on the detector position until you get
   a sensible signal on the detector.

#. Record the detector position (``xafs_detx.position`` or the number
   next to ``det:`` in the :numref:`display (Section %s)
   <cadashboard>` at the top of the top screen) for the current sample
   in the spreadsheet.

#. Move to a new sample position. To change slots on the *ex situ*
   sample wheel: ``RE(slot(##))``, where the number (``##``) is
   between 1 and 24. To change between inner and outer rings of
   samples: ``RE(xafs_wheel.inner())`` and ``RE(xafs_wheel.outer())``.
   For other sample holders, move the appropriate sample stages.

#. To import the spreadsheet into |bsui| (the data acquisition program):
   ``xlsx()`` You will be presented with a list of .xlsx file choices,
   pick the correct one by number and hit :key:`Enter`. You will then be
   presented with a list of tabs in the spreadsheet file, pick the
   correct tab by number and hit :key:`Enter`.  (See :numref:`{name},
   Section {number} <automation>` for details.)

#. The output of the ``xlsx()`` command will display the command for
   reviewing the file (the one with ``??``) and the command for
   running the measurement sequence (the one with ``RE(
   ... )``). Check to make sure it looks like |bsui| correctly
   imported the information from the spreadsheet (you did remember to
   save the spreadsheet, yes...?), then start the measurements.

Align the *ex situ* sample wheel
--------------------------------

The attractive feature of the *ex situ* sample wheel is that it makes
it easy to move from sample to sample.  Once the wheel is properly
aligned in the beam, the commands ``RE(slot(#))``,
``RE(xafs_wheel.inner())``, and ``RE(xafs_wheel.outer())`` are all
that's needed to move from sample to sample.

For this to work, the wheel has to be properly aligned in the frist
place.

Once the rotation stage is in place and a wheel is mounted on the
stage, place a phosphor screen in front of any slot *on the outer
ring*.  The alignment procedure assumes that the initial alignment be
done of the outer ring.

#. Rotate the wheel such that the phosphor screen is in the beam path
   using ``RE(slot(#))``, where # is between 1 and 24.

#. Make sure that at least one camera is looking at the phosphor screen.

#. Secure the hutch and open the shutter.

#. Move the sample stage in X and Y until you can see the spot of the
   beam on the phosphor screen when looking through one of the
   cameras.  Use ``RE(mvr(xafs_x, <amount>))`` and ``RE(mvr(xafs_y,
   <amount>))`` to move the stage in X and Y.  ``<amount>`` is a
   *number* |nd| some sensible distance in millimeters.

#. Using ``RE(mvr(xafs_x, <amount>))`` and ``RE(mvr(xafs_y,
   <amount>))``, move the stage such that the beam is approximately in
   position to go through the middle of a slot on the outer ring.

#. Rotate the stage to an empty slot using ``RE(slot(#))``.

#. Run the alignment procedure ``RE(find_slot())``.  This will perform
   linescans in X and Y to find the position such that the beam is
   passing through the middle of the slot.  The resulting plot should
   look like something like this:

   .. _fig-find_slot_chore:
   .. figure::  _images/find_slot.png
      :target: _images/find_slot.png
      :width: 50%
      :align: center

   An example of the final plot for an alignment of the *ex situ*
   sample wheel. The green X marks shows the aligned positions in
   ``xafs_x`` and ``xafs_y``.


This procedure sets a parameter specifying the ``xafs_x`` position of
the outer ring.  The inner ring is known to be 26 mm away.  Thus, the
positions of both rings are set.  This is why it is important to run 
``RE(find_slot())`` on an outer ring slot.

.. _restart_linkam:

Restart the Linkam stage
------------------------

When it comes time to change samples in the Linkam stage, it is
usually much easier to dismount the stage so that it can be loaded
while flat.

Dismount
~~~~~~~~

#. Turn off the Linkam controller, the black box sitting on the half
   rack underneath the XAS table.  Reach around behind the unit and
   press the power button.  If using the LN2 siphon, you do not need
   to power down the siphon box.

#. Remove the control cable from the stage.  This is the black cable
   with the barrel connector seen in :numref:`Figure %s
   <fig-linkamstageINST>`.  If using the LN2 siphon, also remove the
   two LN2 hoses, the thick gray and thinner white hoses in that
   photo.

   .. _fig-linkam_chore:
   .. figure:: _images/instrumentation/linkam.jpg
      :target: _images/instrumentation/linkam.jpg
      :width: 50%
      :align: center

#. Unbolt the metal bracket supporting the Linkam stage from the
   sample stage.

Remount
~~~~~~~

#. Affix the metal bracket to the same position on the sample stage.

#. Reattach the control cable and the LN2 hoses (if using the LN2
   siphon). 

#. If using the LN2 siphon, you may need to blow dry nitrogen gas
   through the various parts of the system to avoid obstruction of LN2
   flow by water ice.  30 seconds of flowing dry nitrogen should be
   enough to clean out all the lines.

#. Power up the main Llinkam controller by pressing the power button
   on the backside of the black box.

#. At any computer with CSS, reboot the Linkam control software, by
   following these steps:

   #. Click the "Info" button on the Linkam screen:

      .. _fig-linkam_main:
      .. figure::  _images/Linkam_main.png
	 :target: _images/Linkam_main.png
	 :width: 50%
	 :align: center

   #. Click the "Reboot" button in the middle of the "IOC Diagnostics"
      screen 

      .. _fig-linkam_info:
      .. figure::  _images/Linkam_info.png
	 :target: _images/Linkam_info.png
	 :width: 50%
	 :align: center

   #. Click the "Reboot now!" button on the "IOC Reboot Confirmation"
      page. 

      .. _fig-linkam_reboot:
      .. figure::  _images/Linkam_reboot.png
	 :target: _images/Linkam_reboot.png
	 :width: 50%
	 :align: center

      The "Reboot Now!" button will be surrounded by a dashed pink
      outline while rebooting.  When the dashed pink outline goes
      away, the reboot is finished.

      You can close the reboot screen by clicking the little x on its
      tab.  You can then return to the main Linkam screen by clicking
      the yellow arrow at the top of the "IOC Diagnostics" screen.

You are now ready to begin using the Linkam stage.


.. _ln2_fill:

Filling the 25 liter LN2 dewar
------------------------------

#. Open both hutch doors. To open the right (manual) door, press the
   :green:`Front Right Maglock` button (the green light should go out) on
   the HMI panel. Push the door open manually.

#. Open main LN2 valve.  Use the button on the "06BM utilities" CSS
   screen or at the |bsui| command line do ``ln2.open()``.

   .. _fig-utilities:
   .. figure:: _images/BMM_utilities.png
      :target: _images/BMM_utilities.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

#. Lower the dewar to the lowest possible position on the blue lift
   cart.

   .. _fig-25ldewar:
   .. figure:: _images/instrumentation/25ldewar.jpg
      :target: _images/instrumentation/25ldewar.jpg
      :width: 60%
      :align: center

#. Place the dewar close to the LN2 tap, but some distance away from
   the O2 sensor on the ODH monitor.  If using the 25 L dewar, move it
   on the cart at all times.  (If using the 2 L dewar, secure the top
   while moving the dewar.)

#. Don safety glasses, face shield, lab coat, and insulated gloves.
   All of those things can be found in the hutch.

#. With gloved hand, place feed line securely in the dewar with the
   outlet at the bottom of the dewar.

#. With gloved hand, open the manual valve.  Listen to make sure the
   flow sounds OK.  The noise should quiet down once liquid starts
   flowing.  That should take a minute or less.

#. Monitor the dewar **AT ALL TIMES** while filling.

#. Look for the styrofoam float to know when the LN2 level is
   approaching the top. **DO NOT OVERFILL**.

#. When full, using a gloved hand, close the valve in the hutch to
   stop LN2 flow. 

#. With a gloved hand, remove the feed line from dewar.  Slide it into
   its resting place against the back wall, behind the cable trays.

#. Move the blue cart back to its position near the experiment. Lift
   the dewar to its operating height such that the siphon reaches the
   Linkam stage.

#. Do not remove glasses, face shield, lab coat, or gloves from the
   hutch.

#. Close main LN2 valve.  Use the button on the "06BM utilities" CSS
   screen or at the |bsui| command line do ``ln2.close()``.

#. Press the :green:`Front Right Maglock` button. The green light should be
   on. Manually close the right hutch door.
