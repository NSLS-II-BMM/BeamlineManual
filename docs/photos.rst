Harmonic Rejection Mirror
-------------------------

The HRM at BMM is a bounce-down mirror.  The light enters as indicated
by the yellow arrow.  The beam coming from the collimating mirror and
mono is inclined upward.  In :numref:`mode D (high energy,
non-focusing) (Section %s) <photon_delivery_modes>`, the HRM makes the
beam approximately level with the floor.

   the silicon block of the mirror.  This is the **non-reflecting**
   side.  (Right) The reflecting surface of the mirror.  Note the
   differently colored stripes. The bare silicon is the darker stripe
   on the left.  The Pt/Rh is the brighter stripe on the right.


Hoisting
--------

Here are some notes on heavy things get hoisted at BMM.

DM3 BCT Failure
---------------

May 5, 2023: Failure of the DM3_BCT axis

**Symptoms**: BCT could not be moved from CSS or bsui. Immediate encoder
loss. No motion.

After several times restarting the IOC and one power cycle of the
motor controller, I finally thought to take a look at the physical
device. This is what I found.

   The threaded rod had slipped free of the coupler connecting it to
   the DM3 BCT motor.  Once uncoupled, it wound it's way through the
   carriages all the way down, finally coming to rest on the base of
   DM3.


**Solution**: Rethread lead screw through upper carriage. Reinsert
into coupler. Tighten coupler.
