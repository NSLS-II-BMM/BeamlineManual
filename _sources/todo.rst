To Do List
==========

Chapters needed:

#. Dealing with XRF spectra, including ``%xrf``, ``xrfat()``, saving
   XRF spectra 
#. Valence maps
#. Document why M1 is the way it is, explain why moving it is a BAD
   idea, explain front end slits


This is an aggregate list of things missing from the BMM beamline
documentation manual.

#. Replace ``db.v2`` with explicit use of Tiled catalog
#. Document use of ``XDI_record`` to control what motors get recorded
   in the XDI header
#. Flesh out documentation on using automation + spreadsheets
#. Explain contents of dossier more fully
#. Current batch of cameras
#. Document using the Xspress3
#. Better abstraction of spreadsheet-to-macro components, less cargo-cult code
#. Document how redis is used at the BL, explain state+redis+BMMuser object
#. Section about instrumentation development plans at BL
#. Document timescan and SEAD, discuss in plotting section

This is an aggregate list of things mentioned in this document that
the BMM data collection system needs to do.

#. Mode C lookup table
#. Lookup table for E < 8 keV at goniometer


How to add a scan.ini parameter
-------------------------------

#. Add its entry into ``scan_metadata()`` in :file:`BMM/energyscan.py`
#. Add its default value to the ``BMM_configuration``  class in :file:`BMM/modes.py`
#. Add it to ``html_dict`` in :file:`BMM/energyscan.py` around line 912
#. Correspondingly, add to the call arguments of
   ``scan_sequence_static_html()`` in :file:`BMM/energyscan.py`
#. make corresponding entries in the various automation spreadsheets

and, of course, use the new parameter in whatever way it needs to be used.
