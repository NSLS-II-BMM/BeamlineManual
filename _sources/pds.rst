Photon Delivery System
======================

Overview
--------


.. _fig-bmm-schematic:

   :align: center

   Beamline optics layout for BMM.  Thanks to Tiffany Bowman for
   this lovely beamline schematic.

Source
  The source at BMM is an `NSLS-II three-pole wiggler (TPW)
  <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2023.169008>`__.  (See
  :numref:`Section %s <tpw>` for some photos of the source device.)
  This device has a spectrum that resembles a bending magnet, but
  shifted to higher energy compared to the NSLS-II bending magnet.

Collimating Mirror
  The first optical component is a paraboloid collimating mirror.
  This device is 5 nm of Rh on 30 nm of Pt on a silicon substrate.
  This fixed-angle, fixed-figure device corrects the dispersion of the
  TPW source and directs the collimated beam toward the ratchet wall
  aperture.

  .. danger:: There is never a reason to move the first mirror.  It
     is in the correct orientation for collimation and delivery of
     beam through the ratchet wall.  

     :boldred:`Moving any first mirror motor runs the risk of leaving the
     first mirror in a non-functional state!`

Monochromator
  The collimated beam then hits the double crystal monochromator
  (DCM).  BMM has pairs of Si(111) and Si(311) crystals, accessibly by
  lateral translation of the DCM vacuum vessel.  This is a fixed-exit
  monochromator which moves the second crystal parallel and
  perpendicular to the crystal surfaces to direct the monochromatic
  beam towards a small aperture in the pink beam mask and
  Bremsstrahlung shield.

Focusing and harmonic rejection mirrors
  Downstream of the monochromator are a torroidal focusing mirror
  (TFM) and a flat harmonic rejection mirror (HRM).  The TFM is coated
  with 5 nm of Rh on 30 nm of Pt.  The HRM has a Rh/Pt stripe and a
  bare silicon stripe.  The bare silicon stripe is used below 8 keV
  for improved harmonic rejection.

  The angle and bend of the TFM can be adjusted to deliver focused
  beam either to the XAS end station or to the center of the
  goniometer.

  At high energies, either the TFM or the HRM is in the beam path.  At
  low energies, the HRM or both mirrors are in use.  See
  :numref:`Section %s <change-mode>` for details of the mirror
  configuration modes.

See `MA Marcus, et al., J. Synch. Radiat. (2004) 11, 239-247

the Pt/Rh coating scheme.

.. _change_edge:

Configure for an Absorption Edge
--------------------------------

Configuring the photon delivery system for a specific measurement is
usually quite simple.  When moving to a new absorption edge, do the
following:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(change_edge('Fe'))

substituting the two-letter symbol for the element you want to
measure.  This will:

* move the monochromator :numref:`(Section %s) <dcm>`
* put the photon delivery system in the correct mode :numref:`(Section
  %s) <change-mode>`
* measure the rocking curve of the monochromator :numref:`(Section %s)
  <special-linescans>`
* optimize the height of the hutch slits :numref:`(Section %s)
  <special-linescans>`
* move the reference foil holder to the correct position
  :numref:`(Section %s) <sample_stages>`
* set the active Xspress3 ROI to the correct emission line

This whole process takes at most 7 minutes, sometimes under 3
minutes.  After that, the beamline is ready to collect data.

If using the focusing mirror, do this:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(change_edge('Fe', focus=True))

Excluding the ``focus`` argument |nd| or setting it to False |nd|
indicates setup for collimated beam.

This edge change can be put into a :numref:`macro (see Section %s)
<macro>` like so:

.. code-block:: python
   
   yield from change_edge('Fe')

or

.. code-block:: python
   
   yield from change_edge('Fe', focus=True)

In this way, a macro can manage energy changes while you sleep!

.. _foilholder:

Automating reference foil changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A wheel is used to hold and switch between reference foils and stable
oxides.  The standard reference wheel has most of the elements
accessible at BMM, including all the lanthanides (except Pm!).  A
double wheel (:numref:`see Figure %s <fig-doublewheel>`) is used to
hold the standards.  The wheel is mounted on a rotation stage which
is, in turn, mounted on an XY stage for alignment.  See
:numref:`Table %s <tab-reference-wheel>` for the contents of reference
wheel.

.. _fig-ref_wheel:
.. figure:: _images/stages/ref_wheel.jpg
   :target: _images/ref_wheel.jpg
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   The reference wheel.


To select, for example, the iron reference foil:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(reference('Fe'))

In a plan:

.. code-block:: python

   yield from reference('Fe')

The argument is simply the one- or two-element symbol for the target
element.

This selects the correct reference by rotating to the correct slot and
translating to the correct ring on the wheel.

The ``change_edge()`` command does this automatically, so long as the
target edge is available on the reference holder.

The reference wheel content is configured as a python dictionary.  See
``xafs_ref.mapping``, `defined here
<https://github.com/NSLS2/bmm-profile-collection/blob/main/startup/BMM/user_ns/instruments.py#L323>`__.

This dictionary identifies the positions in ``xafs_ref`` and
``xafs_refx`` for each reference sample.  It also identifies the form
of the reference samples and its chemical composition.

To see the available reference materials and their positions on the
reference wheel, do ``%se``.

`Here is a complete list of standards
<https://nsls2.github.io/bmm-standards/BMM-standards.html>`__ in
BMM's collection.

  
..
  Automating fluorescence ROI changes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To make sure that the correct ROI channel is selected, you need to
  configure the ROI readout.  Suppose that you have configured the
  analog detector readout system to measure three of those transition
  metals.  Then you would execute a command like this to configure the
  detector readout:

  .. code-block:: python

     rois.set('Fe Co Ni')

  Unfortunately, the ROI channels and reference holder have the hot
  dog/hot dog bun problem.  There are only three output channels for the
  analog detector readout system, thus only three elements can be
  configured at a time.

  When you change edge to an element that is configured as an ROI
  channel, the data acquisition system will take its fluorescence data
  from the corresponding channels of the Struck multichannel scalar.  It
  will also perform the dead-time correction using the correct signal
  chains for the selected element. 

Parameters for the change_edge() command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically the ``change_edge()`` command is called with one or two
arguments, the mandatory element symbol and the the ``focus``
argument, which can be ``True`` or ``False``.

The full set of parameters for the ``change_edge()`` plan are:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(change_edge(element, focus=False, edge='K', energy=None, tune=True, slits=True, calibrating=False, target=300.))

where,

``element``
  The one- or two-letter element symbol or Z number.

``focus``
  ``True``: set up for using the focusing mirror, modes A, B, C;
  ``False``: collimated beam, modes D, E, F.  Default is ``False``.

``edge``
  If not specified, use K or L3, as appropriate for the energy range
  of the beamline.  Use this argument to specify an L1, L2, or M edge.

``energy``
  Use an E0 value that is not obtained from the look-up table.
  Default is unspecified, i.e. use ``element`` and look-up table.
  This is rarely necessary, except when :numref:`setting up for XRD
  (Section %s) <xas-to-xrd>`.

``insist``
  ``True``: Force movement of M2 motors; ``False``: decide normally
  whether to move M2 motors.  Default is ``False``.

``tune``
  ``True``: optimize DCM second crystal pitch; ``False``: skip ``rocking_curve()``
  scan.  Default is ``True``.  Skipping this is rarely a good idea.

``slits``
  ``True``: optimize slit height; ``False``: skip ``slit_hight()``
  scan.  Default is ``True``.  Skipping this is rarely a good idea.

``no_ref``
  ``True``: skip moving to the correct reference foil.  Default is
  ``False``.  Used when the reference stages have been repurposed 
  for other use in an experiment.

``calibrating``
  ``True``: used when performing beamline maintenance.  Default is
  ``False``.  Rarely used.

``target``
  The energy above e0 at which to perform the rocking curve scan.
  Default is 300.  Care is taken not to exceed an L\ :sub:`2` edge 
  energy (or L\ :sub:`1` when measuring L\ :sub:`2`).


Except for ``edge`` and ``focus``, most of those parameters are rarely
used.  If you need to measure an L\ :sub:`2` or L\ :sub:`1` edge, you
must specify ``edge``.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(change_edge('Pt', edge='L1'))



For all the details about the individual parts of the photon delivery
system, read on!


.. _shutters:

Shutters
--------

**Open and close the photon shutter**
   In the nomenclature of BMM, the photon shutter is ``shb``.  Open
   and close this shutter with::

     shb.open()
     shb.close()

   These plans are somewhat more elaborate than simply toggling the
   state of the shutters.  It happens from time to time that the
   shutter does not trigger when told to open or close.  So, these
   plans try up to three times to open or close the photon shutter,
   with a 1.5 second pause between attempts.

   If you wish to open or close the photon shutter (using the same
   multiple attempt algorithm) in a :numref:`macro (Section %s)
   <macro>`, do::

     yield from shb.open_plan()
     yield from shb.close_plan()

**Open and close the safety shutter**
   This is the front-end shutter.  Closing it takes light off the
   monochromator, which is not something you typically want to do
   during an experiment.  That said, the safety shutter is ``sha`` in
   the BMM nomenclature::

     sha.open()
     sha.close()

   and::

     yield from sha.open_plan()
     yield from sha.close_plan()


.. _dcm:

Monochromator
-------------

The monochromator consists of 8 motors.  It should never be necessary
to interact directly with any of the physical motors.  Plans exist for
facilitating any actions a user should ever need.

**Query the current energy**
   To know the position and energy of the monochromator: ``%w dcm``

   This returns a short report like this:

   .. code-block:: text

      Energy = 19300.1   reflection = Si(111)
      current: Bragg =  5.87946   2nd Xtal Perp = 15.0792   2nd Xtal Para = 146.4328


   This report shows the current energy, the crystal set currently in
   use, and the position of the parallel and perpendicular motors of
   the second crystal carriage.

**Move to a new energy**
   The ``dcm.energy`` virtual motor coordinates the Bragg, parallel,
   and perpendicular motors to maintain a fixed exit height and set
   the energy of the mono.  To move to the copper K edge energy::

      RE(mv(dcm.energy, 8979))

   To move 50 eV above the copper K edge energy::

      RE(mv(dcm.energy, 8979+50))

   Note that the BlueSky command line is able to do simple arithmetic
   (and a whole lot more!).  It is a good idea to leave the arithmetic
   to the computer.

**Move to a new energy in a macro**
   An energy change can be a part of a :numref:`macro (Section %s)
   <macro>`.  Simply do::

     yield from mv(dcm.energy, 8979+50))

**Tune the second crystal of the mono**
   After a long move, you might need to retune the second crystal.  To
   find the peak of the rocking curve and move to that peak::

     RE(rocking_curve())

   This will run a scan of the pitch of the second crystal.  At the
   end of the scan, it moves to the center of mass of the measured
   intensity profile.

   You can do the rocking curve scan by looking at the signal on the
   Bicron which is used as the incident beam monitor for the XRD end
   station.  Do::

     RE(rocking_curve(detector='Bicron'))

   You can tune the second crystal by hand with these commands::

     tu()
     td()

   Those stand for "tune up" and "tune down".  Do not
   think that "up" and "down" refer to measured
   intensity.  Rather, they refer to the direction of motion of the
   motor which adjusts the second crystal pitch.  When you move to
   higher energy, you usually need to tune in ``td()`` direction.
   When you move to a lower energy, you usually need to tune in the
   ``tu()`` direction.  Obviously.....

**Fixed-exit and pseudo-channelcut modes**
   The mono can be run in either fixed-exit or pseudo-channelcut
   modes. 

   Fixed exit means that the second monochromator crystal will be
   moved in directions parallel and perpendicular to its diffracting
   surface in order to maintain a fixed exit height of the beam coming
   from the second crystal.  Without fixed-exit mode, it would not be
   possible to change the energy over the entire energy range of the
   beamline.  The aperture after the monochromator is only a few
   millimeters tall.  The vertical displacement of the beam over a
   lerge energy change would be sufficient to move the beam out of the
   aperture. 

   However, the stability of the monochromator suffers with respect to
   EXAFS data quality when measuring an energy scan in fixed-exit
   mode.  We find it is better to disable the parallel and
   perpendicular motions when measuring XAFS, suffering a small
   vertical displacement of the beam.

   The mono mode is controlled by a parameter:

   .. code-block:: python

      dcm.mode = 'fixed'

   or 

   .. code-block:: python

      dcm.mode = 'channelcut'

   In practice, the monochromator is normally left in fixed-exit mode.
   That way, the monochromator can be moved without having to worry
   about the beam height and the monochromator exit aperture.  In the
   :numref:`XAFS scan plan (Section %s) <xafsscan>`, the monochromator
   first moves |nd| in fixed-exit mode |nd| to the center of the
   angular range of the scan, then sets ``dcm.mode`` to
   ``channelcut``. Once the sequence of scan repititions is finished,
   the monochromator is moved back to the center of the angular range
   and the monochromator is returned to fixed-exit mode.

.. _slits:

Post-mono slits
---------------

After the mono, before the focusing mirror, in Diagnostic Module 2,
there is a four-blade slit system.  These are used to define the beam
size on the mirrors and to refine energy resolution for the focused
beam.

The typical size of the post-mono slits is 18 mm in the horizontal and
1.3 mm in the vertical.

   slits2_vcenter    mm        vertical center          coordinated motion
   ===============   ========  =======================  ===================


The individual blades are moved like any other motor::

  RE(mv(slits2.outboard, -0.5))
  RE(mvr(slits2.top, -0.1))


Coordinated motions are moved the same way::

  RE(mv(slits2.hsize, 6))
  RE(mvr(slits2.vcenter, -0.1))

To know the current positions of the slit blades and their coordinated
motions, use ``%w slits2``

.. code-block:: text

   In [1966]: %w slits2
   SLITS2:
        vertical   size   =   1.350 mm          Top      =   0.675
        vertical   center =   0.000 mm          Bottom   =  -0.675
        horizontal size   =   8.000 mm          Outboard =   4.000
        horizontal center =   0.000 mm          Inboard  =  -4.000

Mirrors
-------

Mirrors are set as part of the mode changing plan.  Unless you know
exactly what you are doing, you probably don't want to move the
mirrors outside of the ``change_mode()`` command.  (Adjusting M1 by
hand is a horrible idea -- unless you know exactly what you are doing
and why.)  Changing the mirror positions in any way changes the height
and inclination of the beam as it enters the end station.  This
requires changes in positions of the slits, the XAFS table, and other
parts of the photon delivery system.

Outside of the use of the ``change_mode()`` command, it should not be
necessary for users to move the mirror motors.  It is **very easy** to
lose the beam entirely when moving mirror motors.  Without a clear
understanding of how the optics work, re-finding the beam can be quite
challenging.  

.. attention:: If you loose the beam by moving mirror motors, the
   easiest solution is to rerun the ``change_mode()`` command,
   possibly with the ``insist=True`` argument.

If you want to know the current positions of the motors on the
focusing mirror, use ``%w m2``


.. code-block:: text

   In [1903]: %w m2
   M2:
        vertical =   6.000 mm           YU  =   6.000
        lateral  =   0.000 mm           YDO =   6.000
        pitch    =   0.000 mrad         YDI =   6.000
        roll     =  -0.001 mrad         XU  =  -0.129
        yaw      =   0.200 mrad         XD  =   0.129
        bender   =  163789.0 steps

For the harmonic rejection mirror, use ``%w m3``

.. code-block:: text

   In [1904]: %w m3
   M3: (Rh/Pt stripe)
        vertical =   0.000 mm           YU  =  -1.167
        lateral  =  15.001 mm           YDO =   1.167
        pitch    =   3.500 mrad         YDI =   1.167
        roll     =   0.000 mrad         XU  =  15.001
        yaw      =   0.001 mrad         XD  =  15.001

The front-end collimating mirror, the focusing mirror, and one stripe
of the harmonic rejection mirror are coated with 5 nm of Rh deposited
on 30 nm of Pt on silicon.  See `MA Marcus, et
al., J. Synch. Radiat. (2004) 11, 239-247 DOI:

the advantages of this coating scheme.


.. _slits3:

End station slits
-----------------

Near the end of the photon delivery system, in Diagnostic Module 3 in
the end station, there is a four-blade slit system.  These are used
to define the beam size on the sample.

  RE(mv(slits3.hsize, 6))

Configurations
--------------

.. _change-mode:

Photon delivery modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A look-up table is used to move the elements of the photon delivery
system to their correct locations for the different energy ranges and
focusing conditions.  Here is a table of different photon delivery
modes.  Modes A-F are for delivery of light to the XAS end station.
Mode XRD delivers high energy, focused beam to the goniometer.


.. _photon_delivery_modes:

.. table:: Photon delivery modes
   :name:  pds-modes
   :align: left

   ====== ============ ========================= 
   Mode   focused      energy range
   ====== ============ ========================= 
   A      |checkmark|  above 8 keV
   B      |checkmark|  below 6 keV
   C      |checkmark|  6 keV |nd| 8 keV
   D      |xmark|      above 8 keV
   E      |xmark|      6 keV |nd| 8 keV
   F      |xmark|      below 6 keV
   XRD    |checkmark|  above 8 keV
   ====== ============ ========================= 

.. todo:: The lookup table is not complete for mode B. In fact, the
   ydo and ydi jacks of M3 cannot move low enough to enter mode B.  In
   practice, mode B is not available.  Elements that should be
   measured in mode B are, instead, measured in mode C and we live
   with incomplete harmonic rejection.


To move between modes, do::

  RE(change_mode('<mode>'))

where ``<mode>`` is one of the strings in the first column of
:numref:`Table %s <pds-modes>`.  For example::

  RE(change_mode('D'))

This will move 17 motors all at the same time and should take less
than 5 minutes.

Focusing at the XAS end station requires that bender be near its upper
limit.  Focusing at the XRD station has the bender near the middle of
its range.

.. _change-crystals:

Monochromator crystals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change between the Si(111) and Si(311) crystals, do::

  RE(change_xtals('111'))

or::

  RE(change_xtals('311'))

This will move the lateral motor of the monochromator between the two
crystal sets and adjust the pitch of the second crystal to be nearly
in tune and the roll to deliver the beam to nearly the same location
for both crystals.  It will also return the monochromator to the
starting energy.

This takes about 5 minutes.

The ``change_xtals()`` plan also runs the :numref:`rocking curve
(Section %s) <special-linescans>` macro to fix the tuning of the
second crystal.
