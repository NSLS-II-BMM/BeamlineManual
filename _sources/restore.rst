Power outage recovery
=====================

.. note::

   This section was started after the scheduled power shutdown of
   April 20, 2024.  I am trying to capture the things I did to bring
   the beamline back to life that seemed non-obvious or were a source
   of friction.  YMMV and this section should be expanded in the future.

Channel Access
--------------

By default, channel access security is set such that access to
beamline PVs is disabled.  This means that motors cannot be moved,
detectors cannot be triggered, and so on.

To enable channel access, do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

		caget XF:06BM-CT{}Prmt:RemoteExp-Sel 1

Thus **must** be done as yourself, not as the beamline operator
account.

If that PV is being reported as disconnected |nd| which is indicated
by the "Workstation Access" buttons on the BMM Main CSS screen or by
the command above returning ``Channel connect timed out`` |nd| then
you need to restart the CAS Switch IOC.

To do that, ssh to xf06bm-ioc2 as youself (not as the operator
account) and do 

.. code-block:: bash

		dzdo manage-iocs restart cas-switch

Once that IOC restarts, try again to set
``XF:06BM-CT{}Prmt:RemoteExp-Sel``. 

Redis
-----

Operations at BMM require that a redis server is running on
xf06bm-ioc2. For whatever reason, the redis server never starts
correctly after a reboot.  

This will become apparent when |bsui| and cadashboard fail to start,
complaining about ``Connection refused`` with ``xf06bm-ioc2:6379``.
6379 is the port that redis uses for communication.

To fix this, ssh to xf06bm-ioc2 as yourself (not the
user account) and do this command:

.. code-block:: bash

		dzdo systemctl restart redis


Xspress3
--------

To re-power the Xspress3 and its associated server:

#. Verify that the power button on the back of the Xspress3 unit is
   switched on.  It should be glowing red.
#. Press the front power button.
#. Once running, restart the relevant IOC on ``xf06bm-ioc2``.  For the
   seven element detector, use ``xs3-7-1``.  For the four element
   detector, use ``xs3-4-1``.


Other IOCs
----------

The startup acceptance tests in the |bsui| profile may eventually fail
when trying to connect to instruments.  For example, this:

.. code-block:: text

   TimeoutError: XF:06BM-ES:{LINKAM}:MODEL could not connect within 10.0-second timeout.

indicates that the Linkam controller is powered off and/or the
linkam3 IOC is not running.  After verifying power to the instrument,
ssh to xf06bm-ioc2 and do:

.. code-block:: bash

		dzdo manage-iocs restart linkam3

To get a list of all IOCs and their status, do:

.. code-block:: bash

		manage-iocs status

Find the name of the relevant IOC and restart it using the
``manage-iocs rastart`` command.

It sometimes helps to know what port number each IOC is communicating
on:

.. code-block:: bash

   dzdo manage-iocs report

IOCs on xf06bm-ioc1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, there is one IOC that regularly runs on ``xf06bm-ioc1``.

================  =================================================
IOC name           purpose
================  =================================================
 Pilatus100K       Pilatus 100k
================  =================================================

This IOC does a lot of file I/O, so it seemed like a good idea to
isolate it from the other IOCs.

All other IOCs on ``xf06bm-ioc1`` must be in the ``stopped`` state.


Motor controllers
-----------------

FMBO MCS8
~~~~~~~~~

Save/restore will not correctly remember motor positions on any opf
the FMBO-supplied axes (i.e. everything except the XAFS and XRD end
stations).  

Restore power to the motor controllers.  It should not necessary to
restart the IOCs (MC02 through MC06), but do so if motors are not
moving after powering up the controllers.

The steps below are the commands in |bsui| for homing sets of axes.  The
``ks.cycle()`` steps are not, strictly speaking, necessary.  But it is
a good idea to be sure the amplifiers are in a good state.  If any
amplifier faults trigger upon starting the homing process, the motors
will be left in a confused state.


.. code-block:: python

   ks.cycle('slits2')
   RE(recover_slits2())

   ks.cycle('dm3')
   RE(recover_slits3())
   RE(recover_diagnostics())

   ks.cycle('m2')
   RE(recover_m2())

   ks.cycle('m3')
   RE(recover_m3())

   ks.cycle('dcm')
   RE(dcm.recover())


After homing, the monochromator should be at 7134.3 eV, which is an
energy within photon delivery mode E.  The mirrors and ``dm3_bct``
should be at positions consistent with mode E.

Some of these take quite a while to go through their homing procedure.
The diagnostics recovery takes almost an hour because a couple of the
motors are **very** slow and have a long way to go to hit their limit
switches.

The M2 bender does not have a homing routine.  To verify its
position, move it by hand to its negative limit:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvrbender(-10000))

That command is a wrapper around killing the amplifier, then moving by
the specified amount.  Feel free to take larger steps.

Once it hits the negative limit, reset its offset 

.. code-block:: python

   reset_offset(m2_bender, 0)

then move it back to position and kill the amplifier:

.. code-block:: python

   RE(mvbender(BMMuser.bender_xas))
   m2_bender.kill()

For reference, the XAS position for the bender is around 212,000.  The
XRD position is around 107,000.


.. note:: 

   **Never** home M1, the collimating mirror.  It is close enough to the
   right position and should never be moved.  In fact, there is no
   reason to power up the motor controller.

   The fear is that an axis might fail far from the correct position.

   The M1 motor controller is in rack MC7-RG-E4 on the mezzanine.  It
   is near the bottom and is the only one with FMBO branding.

Homing MSC8s via PEWIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If homing from the |bsui| command line fails, your best bet is to find
the laptop with PEWIN and connect to the motor controller with a USB
cable.

First, go to xf06bm-ioc2 and stop the reelvant IOC.

Fire up PEWIN.  In the PEWIN command console, issue this command:
``M1x16=1``, where ``x`` is a number from 1 to 8 and indicates the
axis that you want to home.

You can home multiple axes simultaneously by issuing ``M1x16=1``
instruction while other axes are in the process of homing.  PEWIN is
happy to multitask. 

Note that any axes that involve coordinated motion |nd| mirror
vertical, mirror horizontal, slit vertical or horizontal |nd| work
such that all coordinated axes are triggered for homing when any
individual axis is triggered.  For example, to home the M3 vertical
axes, you do not need to do ``M1116=1``, ``M1216=1``, and
``M1316=1``.  When you issue any one of those three instructions, all
three axes will begin moving.



geobrick
~~~~~~~~

Few or none of the motors on the NSLS-II standard geobricks are
equipped with home or limit switches.  This includes the motor
controllers in racks RGC-1 and RGC-2.

Save/restore should remember positions.

The IOCs for the ``xafs_*`` controllers (MC07 and MC08) did not need
to be restarted, however all the goniometer controllers (MC11, MC12,
MC13) did.
